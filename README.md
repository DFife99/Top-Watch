## Bugs 

    - HTML Validator 
        - So when checking the source code for products.html, it does return errors such as input tags inside a tags.
        - Im aware this is flagged as an issue, but i think its best to leave it how it is for UX.

    - Radio Inputs
        - Not so much a bug, but i found out you cant change the colour of a radio button as its set and overridden by browser.
        - To counter this ive made my own radio button, which works out better as it changes based on the colour the user wants for the phone
